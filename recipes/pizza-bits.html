    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        These are ooey and gooey, offering all the flavor of pizza but at a fraction of the labor and time it takes to make a full pizza. 
        Being bite-size not only makes these a great grab-and-go snack for kids but also a fun party appetizer or game day snack.
      </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 package Pillsbury Crescent Rolls , <bold>8 oz</bold></li>
        <li>avocado oil spray, <bold>(optional)</bold></li>
        <li>8 teaspoons pizza sauce</li>
        <li>8 pieces fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>8 slices pepperoni</li>
      </ul>  
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li>
        <li>
          Unroll the Pillsbury dough, pull apart each piece and take each triangle and roll it into a ball. 
          Flatten that dough ball and spray your muffin tin with some avocado spray, if using. 
          If your muffin tin is brand new and non-stick you might not have to spray it at all.
        </li>
        <li>Flatten each piece of dough into the muffin tin and make sure to press it down and along the sides so that it looks like a little cup</li>
        <li>Place 1 teaspoon of pizza sauce into each cup and top with a piece of mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Add a slice of pepperoni on top and bake for 15 minutes or until the pizza bites are puffed up and golden. Enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
